## Problem Statement

Drug discovery is a highly time-consuming and resource-intensive process. 
Existing computational tools for molecular generation and optimization often suffer from limited diversity, slow exploration, and poor usability for researchers. Despite recent advances in AI-driven molecular generation, there remains a gap between research models and practical, researcher-friendly systems capable of rapidly proposing novel, chemically valid drug candidates.
